# Statistics
Statistics for Swift &mdash; v0.1

A custom implementation of [GitHub site](http://r0fls.github.io/swiftstats/) with the purpose of streamlining access to built-in functions and classes.  This is starting out as a personal project to facilitate the authors needs and intersts.

## Features
### Base Functions
- factorial
- choose (nCk)
- median
- mean
- variance
- standard deviation
- erf<sup>-1</sup> (implemented as `erfinv`, whereas `erf` is implemented as part of `Foundation`)
- least squares regression; lsr ([[`Double`]]) -> [`Double`, `Double`]

### Discrete Distributions
- Bernoulli
- Poisson
- Geometric
- Binomial
- CustomDiscrete (new)

### Continuous Distributions
- Normal
- Log-normal
- Laplace
- Weibull (new)
- Exponential
- CustomRanked (new, needs pdf implementation)

And each distribution has these methods:
- pmf or pdf
- cdf
- quantile
- random (takes an optional int and returns an array of that length, or otherwise a single value) 

## Testing

 Run `swift test` from the base directory in a terminal window.
